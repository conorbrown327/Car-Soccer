# My solution to Assignment 2

For ball collisions with the walls and other boundriees, based on the given wall it bounces
off of that vectors x, y or z coordinate is reversed, multimplied by -1.

Pressing the space bar will launch the ball from a given hieght in a random direction.

The ball will also steadily slow due to graity and friction.

Pressing the forward or backward arrow keys will move the car depending on which direction it
is facing. Pressing left or right will rotate the car in that direction.
